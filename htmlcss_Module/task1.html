Q. Define the terms: Website, Webpage, Web browser, Web server, HTML, CSS 

Website:

A website is a collection of related webpages that are typically accessible through a common domain name (e.g.,
www.example.com). Websites are hosted on web servers and are designed to provide information, services, or content to
visitors on the internet.


Webpage:

A webpage is a single document or resource on the internet that can contain various types of content such as text,
images, videos, links, and more. Webpages are displayed in web browsers and are the basic building blocks of a website.


Web Browser:

A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view webpages on the internet. Popular web
browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and others. They interpret and render HTML,
CSS, and other web technologies to display web content to users.


Web Server:

A web server is a computer or software application that stores and delivers web content to users' web browsers upon
request. When you enter a web address (URL) into your browser, the browser sends a request to the web server hosting the
website, which then sends back the requested webpage for display.


HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

HTML is a markup language used to create the structure and content of webpages. It consists of a set of elements and
tags that define the various components of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. HTML
is the foundational language of the web.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of webpages written in HTML. It allows web
developers to define the visual style, colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a webpage. CSS enhances
the design and aesthetics of websites and helps maintain consistency across multiple webpages. */
